# Channable Connect for Magento® 2

The Channable Connect extension makes it effortless to connect your Magento® 2 catalog with the Channable platform.

## Installation
To make the integration process as easy as possible for you, we have developed various plugins for your webshop software package. 
This is the manual for installing the Magento® 2 Plugin.
Before you start up the installation process, we recommend that you make a backup of your webshop files, as well as the database.

There are 2 different methods to install the Magento® 2 extension.
1.	Install by using Composer 
2.	Install by using the Magento® Marketplace
   
### Installation using Composer ###
Magento® 2 use the Composer to manage the module package and the library. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Composer declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

Check if your server has composer installed by running the following command:
```
composer –v
``` 
If your server doesn’t have composer installed, you can easily install it by using this manual: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

Step-by-step to install the Magento® 2 extension through Composer:

1.	Connect to your server running Magento® 2 using SSH or other method (make sure you have access to the command line).
2.	Locate your Magento® 2 project root.
3.	Install the Magento® 2 extension through composer and wait till it's completed:
```
composer require magmodules/magento2-channable
``` 
4.	Once completed run the Magento® module enable command:
```
bin/magento module:enable Magmodules_Channable
``` 
5.	After that run the Magento® upgrade and clean the caches:
```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento cache:flush
```
6.  If Magento® is running in production mode you also need to redeploy the static content:
```
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```
7.  After the installation: Go to your Magento® admin portal and open ‘Stores’ > ‘Configuration’ > ‘Magmodules’ > ‘Channable’.
